/**
 * Base Problem Statement: Design and implement an approval service for an expense review system. Users submit documents, which go through a multi-stage approval workflow (e.g., manager review → finance check → final sign-off). The system should handle creation/approvals/rejections and track status.
 * Core requirements
 * Create/submit a Request with metadata (requester, category, tenantId, and request meta data like amount and so on)
 * Define workflow templates with ordered or conditional steps (role-based: Manager, Finance, Legal).
 * Approvers receive tasks; they can approve/reject with comments.
 * Transition a request through steps: Ex: PENDING → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED/REJECTED.
 * Given a workflow system should give a proper status
 * Declarative workflow representation (e.g., JSON/YAML spec) and validation.
 * Clear domain models
 * Instructions for the round
 * Get core working first; avoid premature optimization
 * Prioritise correctness over features; better to have five solid requirements than six buggy ones
 * Show your thinking with brief comments on design choices
 * Test as you go; verify each piece works before proceeding
 * Avoid API layer and DB implementation initially. Prefer a general class-level implementation. Use a test class (preferred) or main class to run scenarios, and an in-memory data structure with a pluggable interface to store data, which you can later replace with any DB
 * The problem expects candidates to prioritise ruthlessly and make assumptions. Decision-making is key to success. Make and document assumptions or ask the panel for clarity.
 * Evaluation Criteria
 * Domain modeling & design Separate entities clearly. Define clear roles and relations. Avoid large classes or complex abstractions. Each entity should handle its own tasks.
 * State management Ensure correct workflow states. Validate transitions. no skips or duplicate approvals. Track approval history. Handle cases like rejection at step 2.
 * Access control & security
 * Users from Tenant A cannot access Tenant B data
 * Only assigned approvers can act on current step
 * Requesters cannot approve their own requests
 * All queries and actions must filter by tenant ID
 * Code quality Keep clean structure, clear names, single responsibility, minimal duplication, and proper error handling. Deliver production-ready code.
 * Problem solving & extensibility Handle edge cases (missing approvers, invalid inputs). Design for easy extension. Make trade-offs and explain design choices clearly
 * Bonus challenges ( Any one ):
 * Change management: versioned workflow templates; in-flight instances continue on old version.
 * Compensations: if a later step rejects, can earlier steps be revisited? Model as saga with compensating actions.
 * Search & reporting: list requests by status/approver/date with pagination, index strategy.
 * Event publishing: emit RequestApproved to a queue with exactly-once using outbox table.
